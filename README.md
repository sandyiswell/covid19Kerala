# covid19Kerala
Chronological data published by the Health Department in the daily bullettin in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic is compiled and made public for common good.
The data consists of two major files (A,B) with one addendum (C). 

A) datta.csv -> Data from 01/02/2020 to 16/02/2020. 

B) datta2.csv -> Data from 17/02/2020 to until.

C) chronoPositiv --> Confirmed,cured and expired list of patients per district in chronological manner.


The pdf_tabledata_into_csv.py file : In the given website (see below) the daily data is updated in pdf file. This program is use to read table data from a pdf file.The create_folder function will create a folder name called'csv' in the current working directory. 

recoveryPeriod.ipynb: This file generates average recovery period of all discharged (ie, cured) Covid-19 positive cases.

The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing.


### Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook
Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the *IPython notebook*,
and language specific code, such as the *IPython kernel for Python*. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.
